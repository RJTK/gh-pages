      <description>&lt;p&gt;I review some elementary discrete math concepts, use them to describe and solve a neat brain-teaser, and generalize the solution into a form of robust breadth first search.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Stability, Linear Systems, and Semidefinite Programming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamical systems are ubiquitous models occuring in science, engineering, and mathematics.  Not only are they used to model real-world dynamic phenomena like the dynamics of chemical plants, population growth, and physical engineered systems, they can also be applied to model algorithms themselves.  This post focuses on &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; dynamical systems, their analysis by means of semidefinite programming, and connections with control theory through the computation of quadratic functionals of their paths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving Equations with Jacobi Iteration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jacobi iteration is a natural idea for solving certain types of nonlinear equations, and reduces to a famous algorithm for linear systems.  This post discusses the algorithm, its convergence, benefits and drawbacks, along with a discussion of examples and pretty pictures üñºÔ∏è.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <description>My name is Ryan and I like math.
The title of this blog, Quant out of Water, is more-or-less the first thing that came to mind. However, as I (as of 2022) work as a quant at an hedge fund, and I wanted to write a blog that was not explicitly about finance, this title reflects that motivation. I produced the fish with money using a stable diffusion model. I hope you enjoy some of my writings.</description>
