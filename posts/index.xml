      <title>Generalized Eigenvalue Problems and Trace Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people are familiar with the concept of matrix eigenvalues.  Less well known is that this concept can be fruitfully expanded to the &lt;em&gt;generalized eigenvalues&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;pairs&lt;/em&gt; of matrices.  Closely related are matrix trace optimization problems, which extremizes the trace of certain matrix products.  Trace optimization constites a large class of practically solvable &lt;em&gt;non-convex&lt;/em&gt; optimization problems commonly useful for dimensionality reduction and which includes the unsupervised &lt;em&gt;weighted&lt;/em&gt; principle component analysis and the supervised method of Fisher&amp;rsquo;s Linear Discriminant.  The purpose of this post is to explore some of these problems, their intuition, and their applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nature&#39;s Dartboard: The Axioms of Probability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The basic axioms of probability and the idea of a random variable as a function from the sample space to \(\mathbb{R}\) are quite abstract and rather confusing at first pass.  However, the axioms can be well motivated from our intuition, and defining random variables simply as functions turns out to be a brilliant and intuitive abstraction.  My goal in this post is to try to explain the ideas behind the axiomatization of probability theory, and hopefully make the study of measure-theoretic probability seem a bit less intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Group Theory, Symmetry, and a Brain Teaser</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I review some elementary discrete math concepts, use them to describe and solve a neat brain-teaser, and generalize the solution into a form of robust breadth first search.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Stability, Linear Systems, and Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://rjtk.github.io/posts/lyapunov-stability-linear-systems-and-semidefinite-programming/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamical systems are ubiquitous models occuring in science, engineering, and mathematics.  Not only are they used to model real-world dynamic phenomena like the dynamics of chemical plants, population growth, and physical engineered systems, they can also be applied to model algorithms themselves.  This post focuses on &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; dynamical systems, their analysis by means of semidefinite programming, and connections with control theory through the computation of quadratic functionals of their paths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solving Equations with Jacobi Iteration</title>
      <link>https://rjtk.github.io/posts/solving-equations-with-jacobi-iteration/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jacobi iteration is a natural idea for solving certain types of nonlinear equations, and reduces to a famous algorithm for linear systems.  This post discusses the algorithm, its convergence, benefits and drawbacks, along with a discussion of examples and pretty pictures üñºÔ∏è.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <description>My name is Ryan and I like math.
The title of this blog, Quant out of Water, is more-or-less the first thing that came to mind. However, as I (as of 2022) work as a quant at an hedge fund, and I wanted to write a blog that was not explicitly about finance, this title reflects that motivation. I produced the fish with money using a stable diffusion model. I hope you enjoy some of my writings.</description>
