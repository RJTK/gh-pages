      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jacobi iteration is a natural idea for solving certain types of nonlinear equations, and reduces to a famous algorithm for linear systems.  This post discusses the algorithm, its convergence, benefits and drawbacks, along with a discussion of examples and pretty pictures üñºÔ∏è.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>My name is Ryan and I like math.
The title of this blog, Quant out of Water, is more-or-less the first thing that came to mind. However, as I (as of 2022) work as a quant at an hedge fund, and I wanted to write a blog that was not explicitly about finance, this title reflects that motivation. I produced the fish with money using a stable diffusion model. I hope you enjoy some of my writings.</description>
