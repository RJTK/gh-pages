      <description>My name is Ryan and I like math.
The title of this blog, Quant out of Water, is more-or-less the first thing that came to mind. However, as I (as of 2022) work as a quant at an hedge fund, and I wanted to write a blog that was not explicitly about finance, this title reflects that motivation. I produced the fish with money using a stable diffusion model. I hope you enjoy some of my writings.</description>
